Welcome to my Website! I am a PhD Researcher associated with the [University of Tubingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/) working under [Prof. Hilde](https://hildekuehne.github.io/). My research focuses on Efficient Multimodal Models. Previously, I also explored the robustness of vision models, and adaptation of vision-language models in scenarios with limited data, including few-/zero-shot setups.

I have also worked with [Dr. Yova](https://yovakem.github.io/) as a Research Associate.

I completed my Masters in Machine Learning from [MBZUAI](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/) under the supervision of [Dr. Salman Khan](https://salman-h-khan.github.io/), [Dr. Fahad Khan](https://sites.google.com/view/fahadkhans/home?pli=1&authuser=1) and mentored closely by [Dr. Muzammal Naseer](https://muzammal-naseer.netlify.app/)
